# communityForum
A discourse forum for WSOE DJs. 


Inspired by the lack of community during the 2020 COVID-19 quarantine, we created this forum to try and bring a semblence of radio life. This is a place to discuss music, podcasting, news, radio, and more. 

After quarentine, this can pivot to a support and chatting group.
